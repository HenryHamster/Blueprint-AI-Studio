"""Defense-in-depth reaper sweep for release qualifications.

Extracted from ``release_qualifier`` (the module size cap left no headroom for
routine edits).  This is the periodic sweep machinery the reaper invokes once
per cycle to force-finalize wedged / timed-out qualifications and reconcile
out-of-band promotions — a separate concern from the core async qualification
coordinator (run / finalize / promote) that stays in ``release_qualifier``.

The public surface is UNCHANGED: ``release_qualifier`` re-exports every symbol
defined here, so ``app.release_qualifier.sweep_stuck_qualifications`` (and the
``_force_finalize_*`` / ``_parse_started_at`` helpers and the tunable
constants) remain importable and test-patchable at their original paths.

    """Finalize qualifications stuck ``pending`` past the normal completion path.

    ``maybe_finalize_qualification`` is the normal path: a child terminating
    fires a completion handler that finalizes the version once its sibling is
    also terminal.  But if a child dies *without* its handler running — handler
    exception, orchestrator restart between the child's terminal write and the
    handler, a child that was force-cancelled out of band — the version is left
    with ``last_qualification.status == "pending"`` forever even though its
    children have finished.

    This sweep is the defense-in-depth reaper for that case.  For every
    ``ReleaseVersion`` whose ``last_qualification.status == "pending"`` it
    handles two situations:

      * **Both required children terminal** (``COMPLETED`` / ``FAILED`` /
        ``CANCELLED``) — finalizes the version.  The qualifier-smoketest child
        is optional (audit H3): when the qualifying run recorded
        ``smoketest_enabled == False`` only the audit child gates this branch.

      * **Pending longer than ``_MAX_QUALIFICATION_DURATION_SECONDS``** (audit
        H2) — force-finalizes the qualification as blocked (blocker
        ``qualification_timeout``) regardless of child state and raises an
        Alert.  This is the escape hatch for a child that heartbeats-but-hangs
        and so never reaches a terminal state.

    **Per-version session isolation (replaces the old per-version commit —
    audit H5).**  ``session`` is used ONLY for the read-only scan that lists the
    candidate version ids; the sweep never writes through it.  Each version is
    then finalized via ``_finalize_in_dedicated_session``, which opens its OWN
    session, locks that one version, finalizes it, and commits — in complete
    isolation.  A failure (or a real GitHub merge) on version B therefore
    cannot roll back version A's already-committed finalization: they were
    never in the same transaction.  This is strictly stronger than the old
    "commit after each version on the shared session" pattern and removes the
    shared-session rollback/expire bookkeeping entirely.

    Idempotent and safe to call repeatedly: a version already finalized (or not
    actually ready) is no-op'd by ``_finalize_in_dedicated_session``'s own
    under-lock guards.  Returns the number of versions actually finalized.
