"""Release qualifier — the automain → main promotion gate.

Phase 3 of the automain LTS design (docs/plans/automain-lts-plan-v1.md).

The qualifier is an **async coordinator**, not a blocking call.  It scores an
``automain`` release candidate against ``main`` (the last known-good LTS branch)
and, when confident, promotes it.  Confidence is *differential* (everything is
measured as the ``main...automain`` diff) and *composite* (CI + audit +
test-erosion + smoketest).

Two-phase flow:

  run_qualification(session, project_id, version)
      Snapshot the candidate SHA, check CI (cheap, orchestrator-side), lock the
      ReleaseVersion row, spawn a ``release_audit`` agent task and — when the
      smoketest subsystem is enabled — a qualify-time ``smoketest`` agent task,
      stamp ``version.last_qualification = {status: "pending", ...}`` and bump
      ``qualification_attempts``.  Both child payloads carry the exact
      ``candidate_sha`` so the children check out the precise snapshot commit.
      Returns immediately — does NOT block on the children.

  _finalize_qualification(session, version)
      Invoked later (by Phase 3 batch-3 completion handlers — not wired here)
      once the release_audit child (and the qualify-smoketest child, when the
      subsystem was enabled) for this version have terminated.  Reads the
      RELEASE_AUDIT_REPORT and SMOKETEST_RESULT artifacts, computes the
      composite, and either promotes or sets the version back to ``stabilize``.

  promote(session, version, candidate_sha, ...)
      Creates a release branch pinned to ``candidate_sha``, opens a PR from it
      into ``main`` and merges it.  Promotes the EXACT qualified commit, so
      ``automain`` advancing during qualification is harmless.

Session ownership (the merge→main transaction boundary).  ``promote()`` merges
to production ``main``; it MUST never commit a caller's unrelated transaction.
``maybe_finalize_qualification`` therefore opens its OWN dedicated session (via
``AsyncSessionLocal``) for the whole finalize→promote chain — fully decoupled
from whatever session the task-completion handler / reaper passed.  Inside that
dedicated session ``promote()``'s intermediate ``commit()`` (which releases the
row lock before the 30-120s of GitHub I/O) only ever flushes qualifier state,
because the dedicated session has nothing else dirty.  A fresh session also
cannot self-deadlock: the completion handler holds a lock on the *Task* row, not
the ``ReleaseVersion`` row, and the reaper sweep takes no lock on the version
before delegating — so the dedicated session's ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` on the
version row can never wait on a lock the caller still holds.

Hard blockers (CI red, smoketest startup-suite failure when the subsystem is
enabled, any deleted test file) force confidence to 0.0 — those candidates
never promote regardless of the other sub-scores.  When the smoketest
subsystem is disabled the smoketest dimension is dropped and the remaining
weights renormalize (see ``compute_composite``).

Ships dark: actual promotion runs only when ``runtime_config["promotion_enabled"]``
is True.  Otherwise the composite is computed and logged (dry-run) but no PR is
opened.

Public API: ``run_qualification``, ``maybe_finalize_qualification``,
``sweep_stuck_qualifications``, ``_finalize_qualification``,
``compute_composite``, ``_load_policy``, ``promote``.

    """Kick off qualification for the open release ``version``.

    This is the single chokepoint for starting a qualification — both the
    strategic ``qualify_request`` path and the admin ``/qualify`` endpoint
    funnel through here.  It is **self-defending**: callers need no guard of
    their own.  Before spawning anything it early-returns when:

      * ``version.phase != "stabilize"`` ⇒ ``{"status": "wrong_phase"}``.
        Qualification only ever runs on a stabilize-phase candidate.
      * a qualification is already in flight ⇒ ``{"status": "already_pending"}``.
        "In flight" means ``last_qualification.status == "pending"`` AND at
        least one recorded child task is still non-terminal.  Re-emitting
        ``qualify_request`` every strategic cycle or double-clicking the admin
        button must NOT spawn a second pair of heavy agent VMs or orphan the
        prior children.  (A ``pending`` record whose children have all
        terminated is *not* in flight — it is awaiting finalize — so a fresh
        run is still allowed; ``_finalize_qualification``/the reaper handle
        that stale record.)
      * the prior qualification finalized as a ``dry_run`` and ``automain``
        has not advanced since ⇒ ``{"status": "already_dry_run"}``.  In the
        shipped-dark default (``promotion_enabled=False``) a passing candidate
        records ``status="dry_run"`` and the version stays open + stabilize.
        Without this guard the strategic agent re-emits ``qualify_request``
        every cycle and re-spawns two agent VMs for an identical, already-
        scored commit.  Once ``automain`` moves, the candidate is new and a
        fresh qualification is allowed.

    Concurrency (audit C3): two callers can race here — the strategic
    ``qualify_request`` path and the admin ``POST /qualify`` endpoint.  Neither
    caller holds a lock that serializes THIS function: the strategic path holds
    the *Project* row lock (``lock_project_then_task`` in the post-commit
    chain) but that does NOT cover the ``ReleaseVersion`` row, and the admin
    endpoint holds no lock at all.  Without serialization both callers would
    pass the in-flight guard and each spawn an audit+smoketest pair (4
    children, one orphaned pair) and clobber each other's
    ``last_qualification`` write.  So this function takes its OWN
    ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` on the ``ReleaseVersion`` row and holds it across
    the in-flight check, the child spawns, and the ``last_qualification``
    write — that ReleaseVersion lock (not the strategic path's Project lock) is
    what serializes the race.  The GitHub I/O that resolves ``candidate_sha``
    runs BEFORE the lock to keep the locked window short.

    Steps (none of which block on the spawned children):
      1. Resolve the project's owner/repo/GitHub token.
      2. Snapshot the candidate SHA: ``automain`` HEAD (full 40-char SHA).
      3. Check CI on that SHA via ``get_check_runs_cached`` (cheap, orchestrator
         side).  ``ci_green`` is recorded but not acted on here — the composite
         in ``_finalize_qualification`` applies it as a hard blocker.
      4. Lock the ``ReleaseVersion`` row, then re-check the in-flight /
         already-dry-run guards under the lock.
      5. Spawn a ``release_audit`` task (clones ``main``, audits the
         ``main...<candidate_sha>`` diff against main's standards) and — only
         when ``smoketest_enabled`` is True — a qualify-time ``smoketest`` task.
         Both child payloads carry the exact ``candidate_sha`` (audit C4) so
         the children check out the precise commit that was snapshotted rather
         than whatever ``automain`` drifts to by their runtime; both carry
         ``context["release_version_id"]``; the smoketest also carries
         ``context["qualifier_smoketest"] = True`` so its failure does not
         spawn a fix task.
      6. Stamp ``version.last_qualification = {status: "pending", ...}`` and
         bump ``version.qualification_attempts``.

    Returns a status dict.  ``status`` is ``"spawned"`` on success;
    ``"wrong_phase"`` / ``"already_pending"`` / ``"already_dry_run"`` when a
    guard fired (no side effects); or an error code (``"project_not_found"``,
    ``"no_credentials"``, ``"sha_error"``, ``"spawn_failed"``).  The caller
    commits the session.

    """Run the finalize→promote chain for ``version_id`` on a DEDICATED session.

    This is the single chokepoint through which BOTH the task-completion path
    (``maybe_finalize_qualification``) and the reaper sweep
    (``sweep_stuck_qualifications``) reach ``_finalize_qualification`` /
    ``promote()``.

    **Why a dedicated session.**  ``promote()`` merges to production ``main``
    and issues an intermediate ``session.commit()`` to release the
    ``ReleaseVersion`` row lock before its 30-120s of GitHub I/O.  If that
    commit ran on a caller's session it would prematurely commit the caller's
    UNRELATED dirty work (a completed task's terminal status, its TaskHistory /
    Artifacts / remediation+regression records) — destroying the completion
    handler's atomicity.  So this function opens its OWN session via
    ``AsyncSessionLocal``; the finalize chain has nothing else dirty in it, so
    ``promote()``'s commit only ever flushes qualifier state.  ``session_factory``
    is injectable for tests (defaults to ``AsyncSessionLocal``).

    **Why it cannot self-deadlock.**  The dedicated session takes
    ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` on the ``ReleaseVersion`` row.  The
    task-completion caller holds a lock on the *Task* row, not the
    ``ReleaseVersion`` row; the reaper sweep takes NO lock on the version row
    before calling here.  So a fresh session can never block on a version-row
    lock held by the same logical caller — concern (c).

    **Why concurrent calls cannot double-promote (concern d).**  This function
    ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE``-locks the version row at the very top and holds it
    across the readiness check and the decision.  For the NON-promote outcomes
    (``dry_run`` / ``not_promoted``) the lock is held until commit, so a second
    concurrent call blocks until the first commits, then re-reads
    ``last_qualification.status``, sees it is no longer ``"pending"``, and bails
    at the pending guard — the pending guard alone serializes those paths.

    The PROMOTE path is different and the pending guard is NOT what protects it:
    ``promote()`` issues an intermediate ``commit()`` that releases this row
    lock BEFORE its 30-120s of GitHub I/O, and at that commit
    ``last_qualification.status`` is still ``"pending"`` (it is only moved to
    ``promoted`` / ``promotion_failed`` at the very end).  So a genuinely
    concurrent second caller can acquire the freed lock, pass the pending guard,
    and enter its own ``promote()``.  What actually serializes two overlapping
    promotions is the idempotency machinery (``_candidate_already_on_main`` /
    ``_promotion_pr_landed`` — an already-landed candidate routes straight to
    success without a second merge) PLUS the ``version.status != "open"``
    re-check that BOTH ``_record_promotion_success`` and
    ``_record_promotion_failure`` perform under the re-lock before the final
    state write (the loser sees ``status="promoted"`` and bails as
    already-promoted, opening no duplicate vN+1 and writing no contradictory
    ``last_qualification``).

    Returns the ``_finalize_qualification`` / ``_force_finalize_*`` result dict
    when a finalize ran, or ``None`` when the version was not ready / already
    finalized / gone.

    ``timeout_now`` — when set (the reaper sweep passes ``_utcnow()``), the
    age-bound qualification-timeout backstop (audit H2) is evaluated under the
    lock and takes priority over the children-terminal path.  When ``None``
    (the normal task-completion path) only the children-terminal path applies.

    return ``None`` immediately.  The overwhelming majority of tasks are not
    qualifier children and this must be a cheap O(1) no-op — it does no I/O and
    opens no session.

    When a ``release_version_id`` is present, this delegates to
    ``_finalize_in_dedicated_session``, which:

      1. Opens its OWN dedicated DB session (``AsyncSessionLocal``) — fully
         decoupled from the caller's session.  This is the fix for the
         transaction-coupling defect: ``promote()``'s intermediate
         ``session.commit()`` (which releases the row lock before its GitHub
         I/O) would otherwise commit the completion handler's unrelated dirty
         work (the completed task's terminal status, TaskHistory, Artifacts,
         remediation/regression records).  On the dedicated session that
         commit only ever flushes qualifier state.

      2. Takes ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` on the ``ReleaseVersion`` row — the
         serialization point for the non-promote paths.  The ``release_audit``
         and qualifier ``smoketest`` children can terminate
         near-simultaneously, and a reaper sweep can run concurrently; for a
         ``dry_run`` / ``not_promoted`` outcome the lock makes a second finalize
         attempt block until the first commits, then bail at the pending guard.
         A PROMOTE is the exception: ``promote()`` releases this lock via an
         intermediate commit (with the status still ``"pending"``) before its
         GitHub I/O, so a concurrent caller can pass the pending guard
         mid-promotion — overlapping promotions are instead serialized by the
         idempotency checks plus the ``status != "open"`` re-check in
         ``_record_promotion_success`` / ``_record_promotion_failure``.  A
         fresh session cannot self-deadlock: the caller holds the *Task* row
         lock, not this ``ReleaseVersion`` row lock.

      3. No-ops when the version is gone, not ``open``, or no longer
         ``last_qualification.status == "pending"`` (idempotent), or when a
         required qualifier child is still non-terminal.

      4. Otherwise runs ``_finalize_qualification`` (→ ``promote()`` when the
         composite clears + ``promotion_enabled``) and commits the dedicated
         session.

    The caller's session is NEVER touched — neither read nor committed.
    ``session_factory`` is injectable for tests (defaults to
    ``AsyncSessionLocal``).

    Returns ``None`` when this task is not a qualifier child, when a sibling is
    still running, or when the version is already finalized.  Returns the
    ``_finalize_qualification`` result dict when finalization runs.

    """Finalize qualifications stuck ``pending`` past the normal completion path.

    ``maybe_finalize_qualification`` is the normal path: a child terminating
    fires a completion handler that finalizes the version once its sibling is
    also terminal.  But if a child dies *without* its handler running — handler
    exception, orchestrator restart between the child's terminal write and the
    handler, a child that was force-cancelled out of band — the version is left
    with ``last_qualification.status == "pending"`` forever even though its
    children have finished.

    This sweep is the defense-in-depth reaper for that case.  For every
    ``ReleaseVersion`` whose ``last_qualification.status == "pending"`` it
    handles two situations:

      * **Both required children terminal** (``COMPLETED`` / ``FAILED`` /
        ``CANCELLED``) — finalizes the version.  The qualifier-smoketest child
        is optional (audit H3): when the qualifying run recorded
        ``smoketest_enabled == False`` only the audit child gates this branch.

      * **Pending longer than ``_MAX_QUALIFICATION_DURATION_SECONDS``** (audit
        H2) — force-finalizes the qualification as blocked (blocker
        ``qualification_timeout``) regardless of child state and raises an
        Alert.  This is the escape hatch for a child that heartbeats-but-hangs
        and so never reaches a terminal state.

    **Per-version session isolation (replaces the old per-version commit —
    audit H5).**  ``session`` is used ONLY for the read-only scan that lists the
    candidate version ids; the sweep never writes through it.  Each version is
    then finalized via ``_finalize_in_dedicated_session``, which opens its OWN
    session, locks that one version, finalizes it, and commits — in complete
    isolation.  A failure (or a real GitHub merge) on version B therefore
    cannot roll back version A's already-committed finalization: they were
    never in the same transaction.  This is strictly stronger than the old
    "commit after each version on the shared session" pattern and removes the
    shared-session rollback/expire bookkeeping entirely.

    Idempotent and safe to call repeatedly: a version already finalized (or not
    actually ready) is no-op'd by ``_finalize_in_dedicated_session``'s own
    under-lock guards.  Returns the number of versions actually finalized.
